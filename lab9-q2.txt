In the scenario where the data present is 0 we can observe a 3 second rising edge for the time units becuase:
     	 0: C=0, D=0, Q=x, Qn=x
    	10: C=1, D=0, Q=x, Qn=x
    	12: C=1, D=0, Q=x, Qn=1
    	13: C=1, D=0, Q=0, Qn=1
the c value has changed from 0 to a 1 and we observe no latching with the q for that status.

In the scenario where the data present is 1 we can obvserve a 2 second rising edge for the time units because:
	30: C=1, D=1, Q=0, Qn=1
    	32: C=1, D=1, Q=1, Qn=1
the q value latches, and is shifted to 1.

This is primarily due to the order that Qn value and the q is triggered. In the situation where the data value is 0, we have the Qn value set first, and in the other case the Qn is set second.
